# Overview
The .S80 is a proprietary format used by the  [TSI Inc.](http://www.tsi.com/Company/) Aerosol Instrument Manager (AIM) software. The data file contains 160 size distributions that were collected during Southeastern Organic Aerosol Study that took place in Brent, AL, in 2013. The file was kindly provided by Drs. Andrew Grieshop and Provat Saha to serve as a testbed for the inversion program. The .S80 file is included here for tracability. The file was exported as .txt using the TSI AIM software with the flag "Multiple Charge Correction" on and "Diffusion Correction" off, and "Export Raw Data" on. The .txt file was edited to remove a Unicode character that interfered with loading the file programatically.
