    "When parcels of air ascend adiabatically, both temperature and dew-point temperature decrease. As a result, relative humidity increases. When the relative humidity is 100%, the parcel has reached its <i> lifted condensation level </i> (LCL). Ascend beyond the LCL results in condensation and a cloud forms. The temperature profile above the LCL follows the <i> saturated adiabatic lapse rate </i> (SALR). The <i> adiabatic liquid water mixing ratio </i> is liquid water mixing ratio that condenses due to adiabatic lifting. The adiabatic liquid water mixing ratio is zero at cloud base and increases with height. \n",
