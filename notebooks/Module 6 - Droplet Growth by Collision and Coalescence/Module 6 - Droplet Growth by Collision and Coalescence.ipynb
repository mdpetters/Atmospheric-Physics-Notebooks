The warm rain process includes growth by collision–coalescence and limitations to growth by drop breakup. Precipitation produced by the warm rain process occurs in clouds having sufficient liquid water, updraft, and lifetime to sustain collision–coalescence growth to drizzle drop or raindrop sizes. Since warm base (>10°C) convective clouds of about 2 km depth typically have these features, the warm rain process is found to be active in both shallow and deep convection in the Tropics and midlatitudes. The major role of the warm rain process in thunderstorms is to transfer condensed water, in the form of cloud droplets, to precipitable water, in the the form of drizzle droplets and raindrops, by the collision–coalescence process. \n",
