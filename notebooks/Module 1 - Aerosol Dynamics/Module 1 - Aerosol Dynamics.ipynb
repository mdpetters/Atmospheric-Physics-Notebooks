    "Aerosols have acute and chronic negative impacts on human health and the environment. Aerosols scatter (redirect) light, which reduces visibility. The particles serve as condensation sites for water, thereby influencing the properties of clouds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Particle number concentration and particle size are the most critical properties determining how aerosol interacts with the body, the atmosphere, and light. These two properties are described by the particle size distribution. In addition to help assessing aerosol impacts, particle size distributions also provide information about the sources and age of particles. "
