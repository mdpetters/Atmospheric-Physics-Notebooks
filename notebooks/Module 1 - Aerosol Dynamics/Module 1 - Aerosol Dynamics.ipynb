    "Relative mortality compares the mortality of the cohort to the mortality of the general population. A relative mortality of 1.3 means that the observed mortality in the cohort is 30% larger than expected in a similar subgroup of the general population. All-cause mortality is correlated with PM2.5 exposure. The relative mortality risk ratio increases by ~16% for each 10 μg m-3 in PM2.5 concentration. Total, cardiovascular, and lung cancer mortality are  positively associated with ambient PM2.5 concentrations. Reduced PM2.5 concentrations are associated with reduced mortality risk (Laden et al., 2006)."
