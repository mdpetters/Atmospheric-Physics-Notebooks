    "\n",
    "<b> Definition (American Meteorological Society) </b> The initial stage of the collision–coalescence process whereby cloud droplets collide and coalesce to form drizzle drops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally a term for the rate equation to approximate the transfer of cloud drops to drizzle. Because of the low collection efficiencies among cloud drops, autoconversion can be the limiting factor in the formation of drizzle\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "In the absence of ice, formation of drizzle and rain occurs only when the mean droplet diameter exceeds a certain threshold value. Andreae et al. (2004) observed the onset of precipitation, defined asvaircraft-radar rain echo and visible drops on the windshield when the modal droplet diameter exceeded 24 μm. The onset value is sometimes referred to as the autoconversion threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "Without taking into account the distribution of droplet sizes, the droplet diameter is controlled by the number of available cloud droplets (i.e. CDNC) and the available liquid water content (i.e. w<sub>l</sub>). CDNC thus influences the thickness a cloud must reach before rain can form."

    "Aircraft observations of droplet size distributions in clouds demonstrate that the Δz required to reach the autoconversion threshold varies significantly between environments. The figure below shows the dependence of drop diameter on the height above cloud base (LCL) for four clouds. \"Blue ocean\" refers to marine clouds, \"green ocean\" to remote clean clouds forming over the Amazon rainforest, and \"Thailand\" to clouds over a polluted region. The vertical line denotes the onset of warm rain. Data is from Andreae et al. (2004). "
