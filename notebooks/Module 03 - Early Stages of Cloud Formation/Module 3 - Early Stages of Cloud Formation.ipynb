    "As parcels of air ascend adiabatically, both temperature and dew-point temperature decrease. As a result, relative humidity increases. When the relative humidity is 100%, the parcel has reached its <i> lifted condensation level </i> (LCL). Ascend beyond the LCL results in condensation and a cloud forms. The temperature profile above the LCL follows the <i> saturated adiabatic lapse rate </i> (SALR). The <i> adiabatic liquid water mixing ratio </i> is liquid water mixing ratio that condenses due to adiabatic lifting. The adiabatic liquid water mixing ratio is zero at cloud base and increases with height. \n",

    "<b> Figure 6. </b> The figure shows the conceptual ingredients of the link between CCN and cloud droplets. A population of CCN is present below cloud base and is characterized using the fit parameters $C$ and $k$. The CCN  are transported upward within an updraft moving at constant velocity, $w$. As the air expands, both temperature and dew point temperature (vapor pressure) decrease, having the net effect of raising the relative humidity. Once lifted above the lifted condensation level (LCL), a supersaturation forms and some particles activate and form cloud droplets. These cloud droplets grow by vapor deposition which will deplete the supersaturation. This process is described by a general supersaturation balance equation that contains the thermodynamic forcing and kinetic depletion terms.<br>\n",
